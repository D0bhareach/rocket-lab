## Agenda.
I would like to try Rocket framework for backend developmenet.
Server must hold such qualities:
* Response with Templates.
* User sessions.
* Cookies manipulation.
* REST
* React to errors with redirection to specific page.


## Problems.
1. The biggest problem that I run into is Logging. Rocket doesn't have logging system
and since all requests are running in async runtime I tried to use tracing. For now I
didn't find how to use tracing with Rocket.


=======
### Agenda
Would like to try different web frameworks for Rust.

### Summary
All conclusions that I drew could result from my lack of deep understanding and knowlege
of Rust Language. Now in December 2022. I decide to discontinue work with Rocket Lab.
I will not use Rocket for projects. During work I felt quite good.    
Things that were nice: quite informative, extensive documentation web page.
Good reviews from people on the web. For simple tasks you pampered and feel like you
in the right place.   
But when I hit Sessions, Authorization, Autentication. Trait system that is used in Rocket
started to slip from under me. Again it could be from the fact that I only started with
Rocket Framework.    
Unfortunately I didn't write this Summary for almost 3 month after I stoped to commit to
this repo. All I do remember that at that time I hit the wall. And as a consequence switched
to Actix where I manage to pass difficulties that I met working with Rocket.      
16.03.2023: I have no plans to return to this project soon.
