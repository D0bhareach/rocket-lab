## Agenda.
I would like to try Rocket framework for backend developmenet.
Server must hold such qualities:
* Response with Templates.
* User sessions.
* Cookies manipulation.
* REST
* React to errors with redirection to specific page.


## Problems.
1. The biggest problem that I run into is Logging. Rocket doesn't have logging system
and since all requests are running in async runtime I tried to use tracing. For now I
didn't find how to use tracing with Rocket.
